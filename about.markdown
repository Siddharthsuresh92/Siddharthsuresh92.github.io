Hi! My name is Siddharth

I am currently a graduate student in the School of Data Science at University of Virginia.

To give you a brief background, I was born in India and came to the US in 2019. I have always been fascinated with Science and Math, prompting me to take up a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering followed by a 1-year stint in the Oil and Gas industry. In 2017, I made a switch to the finance industry as an advisory consultant (dealing with more numbers) and that's when I also passed the level 1 of the CFA exam.

In 2019, I decided to further my interests in Science and Math and joined school again. I love the idea of solving complex problems using technology. Data is the new 'gold' in my opinion and I enjoy extracting actionable insights from it. I believe the field of Data Science, while still in it's nacancy has a lot to offer. Also, Data Science fits perfectly in terms of what I want to do in life. It's a combination of math, computer science and business.
