Hi! My name is Siddharth

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Sid.png){: .align-left}
I am currently a graduate student in the School of Data Science at University of Virginia.

To give you a brief background, I was born in India and came to the US in 2019. I have always been fascinated with Science and Math, prompting me to take up a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering followed by a 1-year stint in the Oil and Gas industry. In 2017, I made a switch to the finance industry as an advisory consultant (dealing with more numbers) and that's when I also passed the level 1 of the CFA exam.

In 2019, I decided to further my interests in Science and Math and joined school again. I love the idea of solving complex problems using technology. Data is the new 'gold' in my opinion and I enjoy extracting actionable insights from it. I believe the field of Data Science, while still in it's nacancy has a lot to offer. Also, Data Science fits perfectly in terms of what I want to do in life. It's a combination of math, computer science and business.

Given my educational background in engineering and data science, I have a strong foothold in both math and computer science. Combined with my experience in financial advisory where I primarliy analyzed different business from the financial standpoint, I feel a data scientist role is where I am most valuable and will perform to my full potential. I believe most complex real world problems need all three things to work in tandem.

I also strongly believe in the concept of Ikigai (which I am yet to find in my life). I think I'll truly achieve a sense of accomplishment if I find something that I am good at and I love doing which in turn can benefit the world and also make me money. That's what I aim for in life.

I use my free time to create music and play the guitar. I am a big Steven Wilson fan and I absolutely love Porcupine Tree's work. I listen to a wide variety of music but if I had to name the 2 most influential artists/bands in my life, then it'd be Metallica and Steven Wilson. 

I also am a big fan of the NBA, Mixed Martial Arts and Formula 1. So if you're a Steph Curry, Tony Ferguson/Khabib/Connor or a Max Verstappen fan, hit me up and we would definitely have a lot to talk about. I also play chess, so if you're interested, send me a challenge on chess.com, I play under the username: siddharthsuresh92.

I also binge on tv shows like Friends and the Office (even though I've watched it a million times already). I also enjoy reading novels.

Another thing you might find interesting about me is that I would jump on the first chance to go to space (if I had the resources and space travel becomes a thing).

Hope you find something useful through this website. Feel free to contact me through any of my social handles or thorugh my email to discuss projects, interests or anything you specifically liked.
