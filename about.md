Hi! My name is Siddharth and I usually go by Sid.

I have a Masters degree in Data Science from the [School of Data Science, University of Virginia](https://datascience.virginia.edu). I currently work as a Data Specialist at [Yipitdata](https://www.yipitdata.com) based out of New York City.

I was born in India and relocated to the US in 2019. I have always been fascinated with Science and Math. I completed my Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2015 and I have experience in the Oil & Gas industry and in Finance (as an advisory consultant). I also successfully passed the level 1 of the CFA exam due to my interest in Financial Services and Investment Management.

I love the idea of solving complex problems using technology. We're in an era where each one of us is surrounded by valuable data but don't realize it. Each day about [2.5 Quintillion bytes of data](https://techjury.net/blog/how-much-data-is-created-every-day/) is created and about 90% of the world's data was created in the last two years. YES! you can read that again!

I believe the field of Data Science, while still in it's nascency has a lot of benefits to offer to the society and businesses across different industries. Data Science fits perfectly in terms of my career interests and I humbly believe I'm pretty good at it. It's a combination of math, computer science and business. I believe most complex real world problems need all three skills to be solved and that's something I strive to achieve.

On to other aspects of my life, I strongly believe in the concept of Ikigai (which I am hunting down for myself). I believe I'll truly achieve a sense of accomplishment only if I find something that I am good at and I love doing which in turn can benefit the world and also make me money. Until I find that, I am going to keep trying. For those who aren't familiar with this concept, here's a little illustration that could help:

I use my free time to create music and play the guitar. I am a big Steven Wilson fan and I absolutely love Porcupine Tree's work. I listen to a wide variety of music but if I had to name the 2 most influential artists/bands to my life, then it'd be Metallica and Steven Wilson. 

I also am a big fan of the NBA, Mixed Martial Arts and Formula 1. So if you're a Steph Curry, Tony Ferguson/Khabib/Conor or a Max Verstappen fan, hit me up and we would definitely have a lot to talk about. I also play chess, so if you're interested, send me a challenge on chess.com, I play under the username: siddharthsuresh92.

I binge on tv shows like Friends and the Office (even though I've watched it a million times already). I enjoy reading novels. I am a space geek and I find special interest in topics related to the cosmos, life outside earth, interstellar travel and the likes.

Hope you find something useful through this website. Feel free to contact me through any of my social handles or through my email to discuss projects, interests or anything you specifically wish to discuss.
