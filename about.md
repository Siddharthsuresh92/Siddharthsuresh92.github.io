Hi! My name is Siddharth and I usually go by Sid.

I have a Masters degree in Data Science from the [School of Data Science, University of Virginia](https://datascience.virginia.edu). I currently work as a Data Analyst at [Yipitdata](https://www.yipitdata.com) based out of New York City. I've been working at Yipitdata since August 2020. 

I was born in India and relocated to the US in 2019. I have always been fascinated with Science and Math. I completed my Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2015, post which I had a brief stint in the Oil & Gas Industry. Eventually I moved towards my interests in Finance and pivoted into a Financial Advisory role for a couple years. During my time as a Consultant, I also successfully passed the level 1 of the CFA exam.

I love the idea of solving complex problems using technology and my domain expertise is in Finance. But I've also been curious to learn about applications of Data Science in other industries and as such have been researching modeling techniques used in Ad-Tech, Retail, Entertainment industries.  

Data Science for me has always been a combination of math, computer science and business. I believe most complex real world problems require all three skills to be solved and that's something I strive to achieve.

I am a strong believer in aligning the body and mind. I relate to the idea and concept of Ikigai (see illustration below for those who aren't aware of Ikigai). I maintain an active lifestyle and often seek new experiences and talk to people from different spheres of life.

I use my free time to create music and play the guitar. Porcupine Tree is an all time favorite, but I am also influenced by artists/bands such as Hans Zimmer, Animals as Leaders, Tesseract, Tool.

Hope you find something useful on this website. Feel free to contact me through any of my social handles or through my email to discuss projects, interests or ideas (or if you'd just like to say Hi!).
