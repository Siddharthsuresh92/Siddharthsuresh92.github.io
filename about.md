Hi! My name is Siddharth

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Sid.png){: .align-left}
I have a masters degree in Data Science from the School of Data Science, University of Virginia. I am currently actively seeking roles in the field of Data Science.

A bit about my background, I was born in India and relocated to the US in 2019. I have always been fascinated with Science and Math, prompting me to take up a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering followed by stints in the Oil and Gas industry and in Finance (as an advisory consultant). I also passed the level 1 of the CFA exam while I was working in Finance.

In 2019, I decided to further my interests in Science and Math and joined school again. I love the idea of solving complex problems using technology. ![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/datascience.png){: .align-right} Data is the new 'gold' in my opinion and I enjoy extracting actionable insights from it. I believe the field of Data Science, while still in it's nascency has a lot of benefits to offer to the society and businesses across different industries. Data Science fits perfectly in terms of my career interests. It's a combination of math, computer science and business. I believe most complex real world problems need all three skills to be solved and that's something I strive to achieve.

Given my educational background in engineering and data science, I have a strong foothold in both math and computer science. Combined with my experience in financial advisory, a career path in data science is a natural transition for me to push my boundaries.

On to other aspects of my life, I strongly believe in the concept of Ikigai (which I am hunting down for myself). I believe I'll truly achieve a sense of accomplishment only if I find something that I am good at and I love doing which in turn can benefit the world and also make me money. Until I find that, I am going to keep trying. For those who aren't familiar with this concept, here's a little illustration that could help:

I use my free time to create music and play the guitar. I am a big Steven Wilson fan and I absolutely love Porcupine Tree's work. I listen to a wide variety of music but if I had to name the 2 most influential artists/bands to my life, then it'd be Metallica and Steven Wilson. 

I also am a big fan of the NBA, Mixed Martial Arts and Formula 1. So if you're a Steph Curry, Tony Ferguson/Khabib/Conor or a Max Verstappen fan, hit me up and we would definitely have a lot to talk about. I also play chess, so if you're interested, send me a challenge on chess.com, I play under the username: siddharthsuresh92.

I binge on tv shows like Friends and the Office (even though I've watched it a million times already). I enjoy reading novels. I am a space geek and I find special interest in topics related to the cosmos, life outside earth, interstellar travel and the likes.

Hope you find something useful through this website. Feel free to contact me through any of my social handles or through my email to discuss projects, interests or anything you specifically liked.
